Notes for Tax Tools:

 - Parse a machine readable Form 990 and get certain information
 - Build a list of directors as a CSV file 
 - Build a list of grantees (is that a word?) 

Classes/Design:
 - TaxToolsMain -> main class that executes other tools
 - TaxForm --> interface to encapsulate form information
 - BruteTaxForm --> class that uses brute force to find relevant information
 
 Algorithm for finding names:
 1. Create dict with known western names
 2. Check words against dict... If you find a name, you might be at a list of directors!!
 3. If you see one name, you can figure out which other words are also names

 Limitations:
 - names in trie are first names: algo only works if some of the names in the list are 
   common first names that are in our corpus. 
 
 todo:
 1. Find corpus of names to create dict:

 2. Create trie data structure
 3. Create data structure to hold a line pattern
 
 algo: 
 1. add lines with names to a set, use that to determine which are the directors. Use comparator to sort them together.
